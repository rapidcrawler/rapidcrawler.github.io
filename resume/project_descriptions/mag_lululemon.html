    <h1>Steps for Impact Approximation:</h1>
    <p>
        Total Sales Revenue in Gulf Region (R):
        <br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Lululemon's total annual sales revenue in the Gulf region is approximately $50 million
        </li>
        <li>
            Industry OOS Rate: The typical industry out-of-stock rate ranges between 5% to 10% in retail. For
            estimation, let's assume Lululemon faces an OOS rate of 7%.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sales Impact due to OOS (S): Studies suggest that 30% to 50% of lost sales due to OOS are not recovered.
            We'll assume 40% of lost sales are not recovered.
        </li>
        <li>
            Estimate of Wasted Money (W): The wasted sales revenue can be calculated by applying the OOS rate and sales
            impact percentage to the total revenue.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        Formula:
        <li>W=R×OOS_Rate×Sales_Impact</li>
        <li>W=50,000,000×0.07×0.40=1,400,000</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Solution Impact
    </h2>
    <p>
        Predictive ML solution reduced the OOS rate by 40%, i.e:
    <ol>
        <li>New_OOS_Rate=Old_OOS_Rate×(1−Reduction_Percentage)</li>
        <li>New_OOS_Rate=7%×(1−0.40)=4.2%</li>
        <li>New_W=50,000,000×0.042×0.40=840,000</li>
        <li>ΔW=1,400,000−840,000=560,000</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Conclusion
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Impact in Dollars: After implementing the predictive ML solution, the wasted revenue would decrease by
            $560,000 annually.</li>
        <li>Percentage Impact: This represents a 40% reduction in the wasted revenue caused by Out-of-Stock scenarios.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
